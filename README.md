Hi, I’m Ukeme Matthew
I’m a Data Analyst and Data Visualization Specialist with a BSc in Economics. I love bringing data to life through interactive dashboards and compelling visuals. With expertise in Power BI, Excel, and Google Looker Studio. I’ve worked on diverse projects, turning complex data into clear, actionable insights that help businesses make smarter decisions.

Beyond just crunching numbers, I focus on telling stories with data uncovering trends, optimizing processes, and presenting findings in a way that actually makes sense. If you’re looking for someone who can not only analyze data but also make it visually engaging, you’re in the right place.
